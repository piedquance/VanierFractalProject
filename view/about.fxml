It is a simple pattern recursed an infinite amount of time at a smaller scale to get a never-ending pattern. These smaller portions look very similar to the whole fractal. Truly an interesting topic if you ask us! It is entirely possible that you have seen fractals in your life without having realized it. In fact, things in nature such as a snowflake, trees, cauliflower, and many more embody the characteristics of a fractal. These are what you call natural fractals or fractals in nature. However, the one we are going to demonstrate is geometric/mathematical fractals, since they are easier to mathematically conceptualize. There are many fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set, the Koch, and many other fractals.&#10;&#10;The math behind fractals &#10;------------------&#10;Evidently, there is math involved in the creation of fractals. It involves a recursive function, which can be done by calculating a simple equation over and over again. But before we jump in straight to the fractals, let us talk about its dimensions. If one were to consider a line, one can say that it is 1 dimensional (1:1 ratio, so 11.) If one were to consider a square, one can then say that it is 2 dimensional since its surface doubled (1:2 ratio, so 12). If one were to consider a cube, then one can say that it is of 3 dimensions since its surface tripled (1:3 ratio, so 13). With this in mind, in what dimension would fractals be in? Well, if we double a segment of any fractal, we realize that its ratio becomes a fraction. For example, a ratio of 3:4 (Koch Snowflake) would suggest that a dimension of 14/3. The fractional dimension of fractals is typically bigger than their topological dimension. Furthermore, a fractal normally lies in a complex plane, since fractal deals with the reiteration of imaginary numbers. The y-axis consists of imaginary numbers while the x-axis consists of real numbers. In this program, we have limited ourselves to only 8 fractals.&#10;&#10;How will the fractal be displayed in our program? &#10;------------------&#10;Our program is coded such that we place every pixel on the plane. In fact, the user has a selection of fractals to choose from and is also able to tweak the equation to his preference. The equation is then referred to by the name of the set associated with it. With every iteration, we place a pixel on the plane using a PixelWriter. We then use a WritableImage to display the image obtained from an equation. Since it would be very boring to look at a colorless pattern, we implemented a color gradient, which is based on the amount of iteration it took them to escape a predefined radius. Despite fractals being infinitely detailed, it is important to note that our program will not endlessly iterate, as it will crash the program. As a result, we cannot infinitely zoom into the fractal, but will still provide the concept of it.&#10;&#10;Conclusion &#10;------------------&#10;Our program truly shows the beauty that is fractals and ultimately showcases the beautiful art of nature. Furthermore, it helps to visualize this concept while having a variety of tools and options at the userâ€™s disposal. &#10;* Refer to the Help Section to guide yourself through the program.&#10;" wrapText="true">
